               ways link past climate variability and change to human history in
               medieval and early modern Europe (here,c. 700–1815 CE). Within
               this review, we focus on the identification and interpretation of
               causal links between changes in climate and in human societies. A
               revised climate–society impact order model of historical
               climate–society interactions is presented and applied to
               structure the findings of the past 20 years' scholarship. Despite
               considerable progress in research about past climate–society
               relations, partly expedited by new palaeoclimate data, we
               identify limitations to knowledge, including geographical biases,
               a disproportional attention to extremely cold periods, and a
               focus on crises. Furthermore, recent scholarship shows that the
               limitations with particular disciplinary approaches can be
               successfully overcome through interdisciplinary collaborations.

               Roman phase (3rd-6th century AD) of Mutina, an important Roman
               colony situated in Northern Italy. During this period, partly
               including the Late Antique, the seasonal variability with
               inconstant precipitation might have been responsible for
               devastating flood events. In the Po Plain, lying on four regions
               of Northern Italy (Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and
               Veneto), an impressive set of flood events occurred that resulted
               in evident, sometimes thick sediment strata, in between the Roman
               archaeological layers, and after their full deposition. The
               research is a key example of integrated archaeobotanical analyses
               based on five archeological sites (on-site records) excavated
               within the modern city of Modena and studied for
               palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Plant micro- and
               macro-remains were analysed in the framework of interdisciplinary
               archaeological studies, aiming at reconstructing the main
               floristic, vegetational and palaeoecological features of Mutina
               and its surroundings.Since early phases of the Roman age, there
               have been wetlands and thinly scattered mixed oakwoods that
               together with human environments, i.e. cereal fields and gardens,
               characterised the plant landscape of the area. Interestingly,
               during the Late Roman period, the woodland cover increased.
               Overall, the archaeobotany studies highlighted the effects of the
               floods on the city of Modena and its surroundings showing that
               subsequent episodes of floods favoured the expansion or spreading
               of wetlands with the development of hygrophilous woods in the
               later phases, after the flood of the 6th century AD.",

               and tenth century, the medieval eastern Roman empire, more
               usually known as Byzantium, was recovering from its early
               medieval crisis and experiencing favourable climatic conditions
               for the agricultural and demographic growth. Although in the
               Balkans and Anatolia such favourable climate conditions were
               prevalent during the eleventh century, parts of the imperial
               territories were facing significant challenges as a result of
               external political/military pressure. The apogee of medieval
               Byzantine socio-economic development, around AD 1150, coincides
               with a period of adverse climatic conditions for its economy, so
               it becomes obvious that the winter dryness and high climate
               variability at this time did not hinder Byzantine society and
               economy from achieving that level of expansion. Soon after this
               peak, towards the end of the twelfth century, the populations of
               the Byzantine world were experiencing unusual climatic conditions
               with marked dryness and cooler phases. The weakened Byzantine
               socio-political system must have contributed to the events
               leading to the fall of Constantinople in AD 1204 and the sack of
               the city. The final collapse of the Byzantine political control
               over western Anatolia took place half century later, thus
               contemporaneous with the strong cooling effect after a tropical
               volcanic eruption in AD 1257.We suggest that, regardless of a
               range of other influential factors, climate change was also an
               important contributing factor to the socio-economic changes that
               took place in Byzantium during the Medieval Climate Anomaly.
               Crucially, therefore, while the relatively sophisticated and
               complex Byzantine society was certainly influenced by climatic
               conditions, and while it nevertheless displayed a significant
               degree of resilience, external pressures as well as tensions
               within the Byzantine society more broadly contributed to an
               increasing vulnerability in respect of climate impacts.Our
               interdisciplinary analysis is based on all available sources of
               information on the climate and society of Byzantium, that is
               textual (documentary), archaeological, environmental, climate and
               climate model-based evidence about the nature and extent of
               climate variability in the eastern Mediterranean. The key
               challenge was, therefore, to assess the relative influence to be
               ascribed to climate variability and change on the one hand, and
               on the other to the anthropogenic factors in the evolution of
               Byzantine state and society (such as invasions, changes in
               international or regional market demand and patterns of
               production and consumption, etc.). The focus of this
               interdisciplinary study was to address the possible causal
               relationships between climatic and socio-economic change and to
               assess the resilience of the Byzantine socio-economic system in
               the context of climate change impacts.",

               consilience debate, that is, attempts to unify different research
               methodologies that address similar problems. We demonstrate that
               there are a number of similarities in the fundamental methodology
               between history, archaeology, and the natural sciences that deal
               with the past (“palaeoenvironmental sciences”), due to their
               common interest in studying societal and environmental phenomena
               that no longer exist. The three research traditions, for
               instance, employ specific narrative structures as a means of
               communicating research results. We thus present and compare the
               narratives characteristic of each discipline; in order to engage
               in fruitful interdisciplinary exchange, we must first understand
               how each deals with the societal impacts of climatic change. In

               major practical issues that hinder communication between the

               the environment over the last 9000 years. Our study indicates
               that the number of human settlements found scattered over the
               peninsula have quadrupled from the prehistoric to historical
               periods and that this evolution occurred over periods of climate
               change and seismo–tectonic activity. We show that societal
               development occurs both during periods of harsh as well as
               favourable climatic conditions. At some times, some settlements
               develop while others decline. Well-known climate events such as
               the 4.2 ka and 3.2 ka events are recognizable in some of the
               palaeoclimatic records and a regional decline in the number and
               sizes of settlements occurs roughly at the same time, but their
               precise chronological fit with the archaeological record remains
               uncertain. Local socio-political processes were probably always
               the key drivers behind the diverse strategies that human
               societies took in times of changing climate. The study thus
               reveals considerable chronological parallels between societal

               demonstrates the ambiguities in these correspondences and, in

               any potential impacts of seismo-tectonics on societal
               development, need to be part of the interpretative frameworks.",

               radiocarbon dates and 137Cs dating, enable a precise
               reconstruction of the environmental change that occurred in the
               central Mediterranean region during the last ∼4.5 cal kyrs BP.
               Sediments consist of triplets of authigenic carbonates, organic
               matter and clayey laminae. Fluctuations in the thickness and/or
               presence of these different types of seasonal laminae indicate
               variations in water salinity, organic productivity and runoff in
               the lake's catchment, as a result of the complex interplay of
               tectonics, anthropogenic forcing and climate variability. The
               progradation of the Pavllo river delta, favoured by variable
               human activity from the nearby ancient city of Butrint, led to
               the progressive isolation of this hydrological system from the
               Ionian Sea. The system evolved from an open bay to a restricted
               lagoon, which is consistent with archaeological data. An abrupt
               increase in mass-wasting activity between 1515 and 1450 BC,
               likely caused by nearby seismic activity, led to the accumulation
               of 24 homogenites, up to 17 cm thick. They have been deposited
               during the onset of finely laminated sedimentation, which
               indicates restricted, anoxic bottom water conditions and higher
               salinity. Periods of maximum water salinity, biological
               productivity, and carbonate precipitation coincide with warmer
               intervals, such as the early Roman Warm Period (RWP) (500 BC–0
               AD), the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (800–1400 AD) and recent
               times (after 1800 AD). Conversely, lower salinity and more oxic
               conditions, with higher clastic input were recorded during
               1400–500 BC, the Late Roman and the Early Medieval periods (0–800
               AD) and during the Little Ice Age (1400–1800 AD). Hydrological
               fluctuations recorded in Butrint are in phase with most central
               and western Mediterranean records and correlate with NAO
               variability. In contrast, opposite hydrological patterns have
               been recorded in the Eastern Balkans and the Levant during the
               last millennium, emphasizing a complex spatial variability in the
               region. Phases of maximum settlement intensity in Butrint
               (Roman-Late Antique) coincide with warmer and/or stable climate
               periods (0–800 AD and MCA, respectively), indicating a long-term
               influence of climatic conditions on human activities. The Late
               Holocene sedimentary record of Lake Butrint demonstrates the
               complex interplay of climate variability, tectonics and human
               impact in the recent evolution of coastal Mediterranean regions.",

               variations and paleoceanographic/paleoenvironmental changes over
               the past 1500 years for the north Aegean Sea (NE Mediterranean).
               The reconstructions are based on multiproxy analyses, obtained
               from the high resolution (decadal to multi-decadal) marine record
               M2 retrieved from the Athos basin. Reconstructed SSTs show an
               increase from ca. 850 to 950 AD and from ca. 1100 to 1300 AD. A
               cooling phase of almost 1.5 °C is observed from ca. 1600 AD to
               1700 AD. This seems to have been the starting point of a
               continuous SST warming trend until the end of the reconstructed
               period, interrupted by two prominent cooling events at 1832 ± 15
               AD and 1995 ± 1 AD. Application of an adaptive Kernel smoothing
               suggests that the current warming in the reconstructed SSTs of
               the north Aegean might be unprecedented in the context of the
               past 1500 years. Internal variability in atmospheric/oceanic
               circulations systems as well as external forcing as solar
               radiation and volcanic activity could have affected temperature
               variations in the north Aegean Sea over the past 1500 years. The
               marked temperature drop of approximately ∼2 °C at 1832 ± 15 yr AD
               could be related to the 1809 ΑD ‘unknown’ and the 1815 AD Tambora
               volcanic eruptions. Paleoenvironmental proxy-indices of the M2
               record show enhanced riverine/continental inputs in the northern
               Aegean after ca. 1450 AD.The paleoclimatic evidence derived from
               the M2 record is combined with a socio-environmental study of the
               history of the north Aegean region. We show that the cultivation
               of temperature-sensitive crops, i.e. walnut, vine and olive,
               co-occurred with stable and warmer temperatures, while its end
               coincided with a significant episode of cooler temperatures.
               Periods of agricultural growth in Macedonia coincide with periods
               of warmer and more stable SSTs, but further exploration is
               required in order to identify the causal links behind the
               observed phenomena. The Black Death likely caused major changes
               in agricultural activity in the north Aegean region, as reflected
               in the pollen data from land sites of Macedonia and the M2
               proxy-reconstructions. Finally, we conclude that the early modern
               peaks in mountain vegetation in the Rhodope and Macedonia
               highlands, visible also in the M2 record, were very likely
               climate-driven.",

               crops all favored its development and where it had been practiced
               for some centuries before the rise of Islam, the new agriculture

               East, marshes have only recently featured in discussions, having
               often been relegated to the liminalized frontiers of settlement:
               the uninhabitable wildernesses occupying the edges of both town
               and countryside. This is in contrast to the larger role played by
               marshes and bogs in Europe and Central and South America for
               settlement and land use. However, evidence from archaeological
               survey, coring and excavation, primary sources, and ethnographic
               studies has suggested that marsh wetlands in the Near East
               featured prominently in the human landscape. They were areas that
               were rich in renewable natural resources and provided
               transportation corridors and zones of settlement. In pursuing the
               evidence for wetland formation, a noticeable pattern arises
               during the Early Medieval period (the end of the Late Roman
               period through the beginning of the Early Islamic period, sixth
               to eighth centuries) when marshes form and develop consistently,
               encompassing significant parts of otherwise prime lowland areas
               for cultivation. 1 While low-lying regions, where marshes appear,
               have in all cases been susceptible to becoming periodic and
               seasonal wetlands, the Late Roman/Early Islamic marshes
               characteristically (a) became permanent all year round rather
               than seasonal, and often contained a body of standing water or
               lake; (b) continued to expand; and (c) all formed concurrently
               (roughly between the fifth and eighth centuries) throughout the
               Near East. In examples from both the Near East and Pre-Columbian
               civilizations,2 the causes for this have been debated as either
               natural (due to climatic shifts and seasonal inundations) or
               anthropogenic (due to increased land exploitation and intensive
               cultivation). With respect to the latter, a strong link is
               established between the potential human-induced factors for marsh
               formation and its use as a mode of subsistence.",

               hypotheses about social resilience to disaster were tested. One
               was that societies allowing greater political participation and
               access to decision-making were more resilient to catastrophic
               climate-related disasters; the second was that societies with
               stronger social norms were more resilient. Support was found for
               the first hypothesis but little support for the second. The lack
               of support for the second hypothesis seemed odd, as it had been
               supported by other researchers, but a clear rationale for the
               lack of support was not offered. Here the previous study is
               replicated with a sample of 20 societies that experienced the
               Late Antique Little Ice Age. As with the original paper, the
               replication finds support for the first hypothesis and little
               support for the second. It is suggested that the reason for these
               differing results is due to the differing forms of
               climate-related disasters examined in previous studies.
               Specifically, it is suggested that political participation
               provides resilience to catastrophic climate-related disasters by
               fostering bridging forms of social capital, whereas adherence to
               strong social norms provides resilience to smaller, more episodic
               disasters by fostering bonding forms of social capital. The paper
               concludes with policy suggestions that are based on these
               findings.",

               others experiencing only slight cooling changing dramatically.
               This points to variation in vulnerability, and serves to

              approach developed to evaluate the impact of climate change on the
              profitability of vineyards, olive groves, and grain farms in
              Southern Gaul, which were the main source of wealth in the roman
              period. This ABM simulates an agroecosystem model which processes
              potential agricultural yield values from paleoclimatic data. The
              model calculates the revenues made by agricultural exploitations
              from the sale of crops whose annual volumes vary according to
              climate and market prices. The potential profits made by the
              different agricultural exploitations are calculated by deducting
              from the income the operating and transportation costs. We
              conclude that the warm and wet climate of the Roman period may
              have had an extremely beneficial effect on the profitability of
              wine and olive farms between the 2nd century BCE and the 3rd
              century CE, but a more modest effect on grain production.
              Subsequently, there is a significant decrease in the potential
              profitability of farms during the Late Antique Little Ice Age
              (4th-7th century CE). Comparing the results of our model with
              archaeological data enables us to discuss the impact of these
              climatic fluctuations on the agricultural and economic growth, and
              then their subsequent recession in Southern Gaul from the

               multiple formerly thriving farming villages at the edges of the

               paper presents a new perspective on causes of this abandonment by
               synthesizing existing research. The papyri as well as the
               archaeological record imply that irrigation problems arising
               simultaneously from the third century CE lay at the heart of the
               problem and led to the progressive desertification of formerly
               agricultural land. The surviving documentation allows us to trace
               what increasing water stress meant on the ground for the local
               population and what adaption strategies they undertook to deal
               with the degradation and desertification of their farmlands.
               While socio-economic factors certainly played a role in the
               decline of these settlements, a change in environmental
               conditions should be considered as well. In fact, natural proxies

               archaeological survey and a comprehensive radiocarbon dating
               programme in the Wadi Draa, Morocco. The Draa Valley contains
               some of the largest, most populous and most productive oases in
               the Sahara, as well as serving as an important travel corridor
               for trading caravans coming from West Africa to access the Atlas
               passes and reach Marrakech. Focusing on evidence from a large
               zone of abandoned oases on the Kasr Bounou Plain, this article
               demonstrates that while oasis agriculture and settlement was
               taking place between the 4th–8th centuries—well before the Muslim
               conquest of Morocco—there was a significant increase in
               settlement and agricultural exploitation from the 9th century.
               This phenomenon is marked by the appearance of substantial
               mudbrick settlements, along with irrigation and field systems,
               and is coterminous with the development of the medieval trading
               entrepôt of Sijilmasa. A settlement boom and significant
               investment in irrigated oasis agriculture occurred between the
               11th and 13th centuries, contemporary with Almoravid and Almohad
               rule of the Draa, followed by a retraction and abandonment of
               much of the oasis by the 16th century. The new evidence from the
               Draa challenges the long-held belief that sedentarization and
               irrigated oasis agriculture were unique to the medieval period in

              Este artículo se propone explorar cómo esta riqueza se desarrolla
              en un entorno climático desafiante. Para ello, se analizará el
              clima histórico de la región, dentro del fenómeno conocido con el
              apodo de “Anomalía Climática Medieval”, y su relación con la
              producción agrícola. A través de ello, se verá cómo sus cultivos,
              basados principalmente en cereales, están sometidos a los cambios
              de las fluctuaciones oceánicas, que traen consigo las posibles
              lluvias de las cuales depende la producción cerealística. Se
              abordarán otros factores climáticos, como las nevadas y la aridez,
              que también impactan en la región. Se destacarán los esfuerzos de
              los habitantes del Sūs al-Aqṣà para aprovechar un territorio
              fértil en un clima semiárido, haciendo uso de las capas freáticas
              y beneficiándose de los ciclos de lluvia. Este ejemplo es capaz de
              demostrar cómo el clima, por un lado, y la propia orografía
              específica del territorio, por otro, influyen en el desarrollo del
              estilo de vida de las poblaciones, actuando directamente en la
              labor del campo y la producción de alimento. Asimismo, se
              destacará la adaptación de estas poblaciones, especialmente, de
              los Maṣmūda, a todo tipo de ecosistema y se verá cómo esto último

               past climate; hence they should be updated whenever significant
               amounts of new data become available. Here, the Greenland
               ice-core chronology GICC05 was revised for the last 3835 years by
               synchronizing six deep ice cores and three shallow ice cores from
               the central Greenland ice sheet. A new method was applied by
               combining automated counting of annual layers on multiple
               parallel proxies and manual fine-tuning. A layer counting bias
               was found in all ice cores because of site-specific signal
               disturbances; therefore the manual comparison of all ice cores
               was deemed necessary to increase timescale accuracy. After
               examining sources of error and their correlation lengths, the
               uncertainty rate was quantified to be 1 year per century. The new
               timescale is younger than GICC05 by about 13 years at 3835 years
               ago. The most recent 800 years are largely unaffected by the
               revision. Between 800 and 2000 years ago, the offset between
               timescales increases steadily, with the steepest offset occurring
               between 800 and 1100 years ago. Moreover, offset oscillations of
               about 5 years around the average are observed between 2500 and
               3800 years ago. The non-linear offset behavior is attributed to
               previous mismatches of volcanic eruptions, to the much more
               extensive dataset available to this study, and to the finer
               resolution of the new ice-core ammonium matching. By analysis of
               the common variations in cosmogenic radionuclides, the new
               ice-core timescale is found to be in alignment with the IntCal20
